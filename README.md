## Setup Project

npm install or yarn install

## Getting Started

npm run dev or yarn dev

## Problem

I only had problems in NextJs and Typescript. Because I don't have too much experience with it yet. I only have strengths in ReactJs and Javascript. And quite time consuming in the html, css style. But these are the challenges that I want to try and also the technologies I am looking to learn and develop. So it's pretty good for the evening to experience.

## Solution

Because I realize that it will be quite difficult to do the test right away. So before I did the test I went to learn and read the documentation about NextJs and Typescript quite a lot. As for the times when the style is too time-consuming, I will spend time analyzing the design and researching for more reference.
